# To assign the above class(template) to an object you would do the following:
myobjectx = MyClass()

# Now the variable "myobjectx" holds an object of the class "MyClass" that contains 
# the variable and the function defined within the class called "MyClass".

# To access the variable inside of the newly created object "myobjectx" you would do the following:

myobjectx.variable

# So for instance the below would output the string "blah":

print(myobjectx.variable)

# You can create multiple different objects that are of the same class(have the 
# same variables and functions defined). However, each object contains independent 
# copies of the variables defined in the class. For instance, if we were to define 
# another object with the "MyClass" class and then change the string in the variable 
# above:

class MyClass:
    variable = "blah"

    def function(self):
        print("This is a message inside the class")

myobjectx = MyClass()
myobjecty = MyClass()

myobjecty.variable = "yackity"

# Then print out both values
print(myobjectx.variable)
print(myobjecty.variable)

# To access a function inside of an object you use notation similar to accessing a variable:
class MyClass:
    variable = "blah"

    def function(self):
        print("This is a message inside the class")
