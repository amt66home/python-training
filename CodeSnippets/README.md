# Python

Arithmetic operations:

+	Add two operands or unary plus 
    eg x + y+ 2

-	Subtract right operand from the left or unary minus    
    eg	x - y- 2

*	Multiply two operands 
    eg	x * y

/	Divide left operand by the right one (always results into float) 
    eg	x / y

%	Modulus - remainder of the division of left operand by the right 
    eg	x % y (remainder of x/y)

//	Floor division - division that results into whole number adjusted to the  left in the number line 
    eg	x // y

**	Exponent - left operand raised to the power of right 
    eg	x**y (x to the power y)
